## ‚öôÔ∏è Formula Used

The calculator relies on the standard Compound Interest formula:

$$A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{(n \times t)}$$

Where:
* $A$ = **Maturity Amount** (Final Value)
* $P$ = **Principal Amount** (Initial Investment)
* $r$ = **Annual Interest Rate** (as a decimal)
* $n$ = **Compounding Frequency** per year
* $t$ = **Time Period** (in years)
